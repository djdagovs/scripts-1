#!/bin/bash
# A bash script that uses 'mv' to move files to '~/.easyrmtmp' and provides arguments to clear out '~/.easyrmtmp'; meant to replace using 'rm' on files and folders in case you aren't sure about deleting them.

X="v1.0.8 - Removed '-p'; not needed in this script.  Changed '-f' to remove files in '~/.easyrmtmp' by force instead of removing user inputted files."

#!/bin/bash
# A bash script that uses 'mv' to move files to '~/.easyrmtmp' and provides arguments to clear out '~/.easyrmtmp'; meant to replace using 'rm' on files and folders in case you aren't sure about deleting them.
# Created by simonizor 3/11/2017

# A POSIX variable
OPTIND=1         # Reset in case getopts has been used previously in the shell.

ERMVER="1.0.9"
X="v1.0.9 - Cleaned up a few things and made script not run without any input."
# ^^ Remember to update these and ermversion.txt every release!

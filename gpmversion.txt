GPMVER="1.0.8"
X="v1.0.8 - Added zenity dialogs when running './gpgpassman dec' to let user know if password was copied or if gpg password was incorrect."

Plans: Add GUI using zenity if launched without cases or use read -p dialog to choose options if zenity is not installed.
        EASY:
        If gpgpassman is ran without arguments, run zenity and set ZHEADLESS="1", and create if statements for zenity dialogs in all cases.
        Add 'nogui' case to run without zenity.
        Add this to other scripts -- discorddownloader, apttool, easyrm (maybe), aptmarklist (maybe), speedtest (maybe).
        MAYBE:
        Make a separate function for read -p list and make functions return to read -p list so program can stay open in terminal.
        Take all code from cases, and turn them into functions to be used when ran without case.
        If zenity is installed and gpgpassman is ran without case, list gpgpassman options that launch zenity functions.
        Make separate functions for each case for zenity.
        Make zenity main list a separate function and make zenity functions return to main menu when finished so program can stay open.
        After doing all of this, create separate repo for gpgpassman and remove '.sh' from file name.
        Possibly create deb or PPA for gpgpassman?
